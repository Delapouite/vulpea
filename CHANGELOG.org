Primarily a stabilization and bug-fix release.

*Features*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/84][vulpea#84]] Support passing extra context for templates to =vulpea-create=. This
  is a /breaking change/, now instead of passing =id= argument, you should pass
  =(list (cons 'id id))=. While being more verbose it gives much more power.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/85][vulpea#85]] Support require match in =vulpea-select=. This is a /breaking
  change/, as arguments to =vulpea-select= are passed as keys. In my experience,
  most of the times first two arguments are =nil= and they are rarely needed. In
  this way, API of this function is cleaner and opens a way to add new
  functionality there.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/86][vulpea#86]] New function =vulpea-db-query= to query notes with generic predicate.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/86][vulpea#86]] Add metadata to =vulpea-note= consisting of access time and
  modification time.

*Fixes*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/80][vulpea#80]] Fix how =org-roam-capture--new-file= is called from advice.

*Breaking changes*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/82][vulpea#82]] Remove all autoloads.

** v0.1

*Features*

- =vulpea= module - one stop module, importing all others.
  - =vulpea-select= - function to =completing-read= a note with optional filter.
  - =vulpea-create= - function to create a new note file with given =TITLE= and
    =TEMPLATE=.
- =vulpea-db= module - for querying notes data base.
  - =vulpea-db-get-id-by-file= - function to get =ID= of a note represented by
    =FILE=.
  - =vulpea-db-get-by-id= - function to get note represented by =ID=. Supports
    headings of the note.
  - =vulpea-db-get-file-by-id= - function to get =FILE= of a note represented by
    =ID=. Supports headings of the note.
  - =vulpea-db-search-by-title= - function to query notes with =TITLE=.
  - =vulpea-db-update= - function to update db with =NOTE-OR-ID=.
- =vulpea-meta= module - for manipulating note metadata represented by
  description list:
  - =vulpea-meta= - function to get metadata from =NOTE-OR-ID=. In most cases
    you should not use this function unless performance is important. In this
    case, take a look at bang functions, e.g. =vulpea-meta-get!=.
  - =vulpea-meta-get= - function to get a value of =PROP= for note with =ID=.
    Value is parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or as a string if omitted.
  - =vulpea-meta-get!= - function to get a value of =PROP= from =META= (result
    of =vulpea-meta=). Value is parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or as a string
    if omitted. Use it performing multiple read operations in a row.
  - =vulpea-meta-get-list= - function to get all values of =PROP= for note with
    =ID=. Values are parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or as a string if
    omitted.
  - =vulpea-meta-get-list!= - function to get all values of =PROP= from =META=
    (result of =vulpea-meta=). Values are parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or
    as a string if omitted. Use it performing multiple read operations in a row.
  - =vulpea-meta-set= - function to set =VALUE= of =PROP= for =NOTE-OR-ID=.
    Supports multi-value properties.
  - =vulpea-meta-remove= - function to remove a =PROP= for =NOTE-OR-ID=.
  - =vulpea-meta-remove= - function to remove all meta for =NOTE-OR-ID=.
  - =vulpea-meta-format= - function to format a =VALUE=.
- =vulpea-utils= module.
  - =vulpea-note= type definition.
  - =vulpea-utils-with-note= - function to execute =BODY= with point at =NOTE=.
    Supports file-level notes as well as heading notes.
  - =vulpea-utils-link-make-string= - make a bracket link to =NOTE=.
