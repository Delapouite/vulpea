    Value is parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or as a string if omitted.

    if omitted. Use it performing multiple read operations in a row.
  - =vulpea-meta-get-list= - function to get all values of =PROP= for note with
    =ID=. Values are parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or as a string if
    omitted.
  - =vulpea-meta-get-list!= - function to get all values of =PROP= from =META=
    (result of =vulpea-meta=). Values are parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or
    as a string if omitted. Use it performing multiple read operations in a row.
